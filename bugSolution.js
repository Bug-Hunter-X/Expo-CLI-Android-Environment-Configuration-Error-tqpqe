To solve this issue, follow these steps:
1. **Ensure Android SDK is installed and configured correctly:** Verify that the Android SDK is installed and its path is correctly set in your system's environment variables (ANDROID_HOME, PATH). Refer to the official Android developer documentation for detailed instructions.
2. **Install required Android SDK components:** Ensure that you have installed the necessary build tools, platforms, and Android SDK components required by your Expo project. The Expo CLI might provide specific error messages indicating which components are missing.
3. **Check Java Development Kit (JDK):** Confirm that you have a compatible JDK installed and configured correctly. Expo requires a specific JDK version; check the Expo documentation for compatibility details. 
4. **Restart your system:** After making changes to environment variables or installing SDK components, restart your system or IDE to ensure changes take effect.
5. **Clean and rebuild:** Use `expo prebuild` and then `expo run:android` commands to force a clean rebuild of your project. This can sometimes resolve temporary build system issues.
6. **Update Expo CLI and SDK:** Make sure you have the latest versions of Expo CLI and the Android SDK. Run `npm update -g expo-cli` and consider updating the Android SDK using the Android SDK Manager.
7. **Check for conflicting installations:** If you have multiple versions of Java or Android SDKs installed, it could cause conflicts. Try uninstalling older or conflicting versions.
8. **Check for errors in `.android` directory:** Look for any error messages within the `.android` directory in your project. These messages might provide more context regarding the issue.

By following these steps and consulting the official Expo and Android developer documentation, you should be able to resolve the Android environment configuration error and successfully build your Expo project for Android.
